## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Jekyll - _<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation" target="_blank">view the Jekyll docs for the installation guide_</a>

### Usage

The HTML used throughout the website is broken down into partials stored in the `_includes` folder.

The base HTML layout for pages on the website is stored in the `_layouts` folder.

The styling is stored in the `_sass` folder.

The posts are stored in the `_posts` folder.

_For more information, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure" target="_blank">view the Jekyll docs about the directory structure</a>_.

### Deployment

To build the website, run the following command in the root of the repo:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This creates a `_site` folder where the generated site will be placed.

To view the website, open the link of the server address displayed in the terminal.

Alternatively, to view the website automatically after building, run the the following command:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --open-url
```
