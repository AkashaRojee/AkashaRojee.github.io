Hello!

I'm Akasha Rojee.

I started this blog as a way to document my dev learning journey as well as to share information to help others.

When I'm not coding, I listen to Metal and I lift weights.

You can find me on GitHub [@AkashaRojee](https://github.com/AkashaRojee).

E-mail me at <Akasha.Rojee@gmail.com>.
